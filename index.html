                The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. Size and appearance vary considerably between the sexes. The maleâ€™s outstanding characteristic is his mane, which varies between different individuals and populations. It may be entirely lacking; it may fringe the face; or it may be full and shaggy, covering the back of the head, neck, and shoulders and continuing onto the throat and chest to join a fringe along the belly. <br>
